<h4>Design Process </h4>
<h5>Who are the users of the website?</h5>
<ul>
<li>
People who want to donate their money or give their items to people who need it.</li>
<li>People who want to receive the help in their own countries.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The people want to know about who they are helping and how they can help.</p>
<p>
As a user who still do not fully trust the website, they want to check for the reliability of the website. Therefore, the website should show the viewers the relevant information about the website to earn their trust. For example, showing them the collaborations the website has with the governments or any other reliable and known organizations. The website should also give details about how they carry out the work for the website. For example, how the website confirms the truthfulness of the people who need the help. However, this is a made up website so there are no collaborations.
</p>
<p>
As a user who wants to receive the help they need from this website, they would want to know how they can get selected to get help. Therefore, they can get information after clicking "Get CW account".
</p>
<p>
As a user who wants to help the people through this website, the website can provide them with options for them to help like meet up or mailing of items. If they help with money, they can only meet up with the person to give. If they want to help with household items or other daily essentials like food, they can meet up with the person to give or mail the things to the address given by the website. For the people who want to meet up, they can discuss this with the person who wants the help via message given by the website. However, message only receives the time when they meet up. The time can only be in the morning or afternoon. This is to avoid any undesirable problems or situations. Therefore, making the meet up feel safer for both individuals. Also, to ensure the safety of the meet up, the messages are made private for both the person giving the help and the person receiving the help.

<h5>Website features</h5>
<p>Feature 1: When the people who need the help proceed to post, they can fill in two things first, their names(not full names) and their reasons for seeking help by selecting from a list of reasons like medical, learning, jobless and others. These details are going to be shown first to users. If they managed to attract the users, they should also fill in their full details about their situation. For example, the problems they are facing, help they need, how this help may benefit them, the country they stay at currently and the places where they can meet up with people.
<p>Feature 2: Only people who need help have CW(Caring World) accounts. They can sign in to have different interfaces if they have a CW account and if they don't. They have to sign in at different buttons for whether they have or don't have a CW account. If they are interested to have a CW account, they would have to click "Get CW account".</p>
<p> Feature 3: There will be search bar for them to input the name of the person whom they are interested to help. There will also be a filter for them to choose which country they want to help the people who are in currently. However, these inputs are not neccessary as in the main page, there is a list of people from top to bottom: the people who need the most help to the people who need the least help for them to help. </p>
<p>Feature 4: At first look, the people that need the help are shown in posts that have both details, their name and their reason for seeking help.</p>

It will show a form which asks for both details, what help you are giving(money,household items, daily essentials), and how to deliver the help(delivery or meet up).</p>
<p>If the person choose to help in meet up way, the person would need to give details in another page about the time they want to meet up. The time they want to meet up would require the date of meet up and the time. However, they are required to choose from a list of timings. After they clicked the submit button, they will be send to a page that says, "he/she will give you his/her response to your message soon."</p>
<p>If the person choose to help in delivery way, they will be send to a page for them to input the country where they are now at and there will be options of places where they can deliver the items to. After they selected, the full address of the place will be given at the end of the page. There will also be a message that says,"here is the address for you to deliver to. Thank you so much for your kindness. We will be grateful.Please also type your address at the bottom of the page so that we would know it is you." There will be a text for them to fill for their address.</p>
<p>Feature 6: The people who are helping the people can save the people's posts in "People you are helping" to remember if they need to meet up or deliver things.</p>
<p>Feature 7: For people who are receiving the help, they would get notifications in "Message received" if they are people who have agreed to help them by mailing or by meeting up with them. For meet ups, they would need to give their consent to continue with the meet up. They have to input a 'i can meet up/sorry i can't'. If 'sorry i can't' they can send back a message of a preferred time of meeting up with them.</p>
