    <h4>What is the purpose of the website?</h4>

</h1>
<h4>Design Process </h4>
<h5>Who are the users of the website?</h5>
<ul>
<li>
People who want to donate their money or give their items to people who need it.</li>
<li>People who want to receive the help in their own countries.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The people want to know about who they are helping and how they can help.</p>
<p>
As a user who still do not fully trust the website, they want to check for the reliability of the website. Therefore, the website should show the viewers the relevant information about the website to earn their trust. For example, showing them the collaborations the website has with the governments or any other reliable and known organizations. The website should also give details about how they carry out the work for the website. For example, how the website confirms the truthfulness of the people who need the help. However, this is a made up website so there are no collaborations.
</p>
<p>
As a user who wants to receive the help they need from this website, they would want to know how they can get selected to get help. Therefore, they can get information after clicking "Get CW account".
</p>
<p>
As a user who wants to help the people through this website, the website can provide them with options for them to help like meet up or mailing of items. If they help with money, they can only meet up with the person to give. If they want to help with household items or other daily essentials like food, they can meet up with the person to give or mail the things to the address given by the website. For the people who want to meet up, they can discuss this with the person who wants the help via message given by the website. However, message only receives the time when they meet up. The time can only be in the morning or afternoon. This is to avoid any undesirable problems or situations. Therefore, making the meet up feel safer for both individuals. Also, to ensure the safety of the meet up, the messages are made private for both the person giving the help and the person receiving the help. 
</p>
<h5>Website features</h5>
<p>Feature 1: Only people who need help have CW(Caring World) accounts. They can sign in to have different interfaces if they have a CW account and if they don't. They have to sign in at different buttons for whether they have or don't have a CW account. If they are interested to have a CW account, details are given before the sign in buttons so that they know about it.</p>
<p> Feature 2: There will two search bars to search for the selected people they can help. One of the search bars are for them to input the amount of money they are willing to offer. The other one is for them to choose which country they want to help the people who are in currently. However, these inputs are not neccessary as in the main page, there is a list of people from top to bottom: the people who need the most help to the people who need the least help that they can help. </p>
<p>Feature 3: After signing in, the people that need the help are shown in posts that have details, their name, their reason for seeking help and the country they are currently at.</p>
<p> Feature 4: If interested to help, they can select the person they want to help and then click on the "Message to help" button. It will show a form which asks for both details about the type of help they are giving(money, others), and the details about how they can deliver the help.</p>
<p>If the person choose to help in meet up way, after they selected, "Message to help", they will be send to a page for them to give details about the time they want to meet up. The time they want to meet up would require the date of meet up and the time. They would need to give three dates that they are available.</p>
<p>If the person choose to help in delivery way, after they selected, "Message to help", they will be send to a page for them to choose any of the options of places where they can deliver the items to. After they selected, they will be needed to type their address at the bottom of the page to identify them.</p>
<p>Feature 5: The people who need to be meeting the people will have the person's, whom they are helping, details saved in the "Who you are meeting" to remind them.</p>
<p>Feature 6: For people who are receiving the help, they would get messages in "Help received" if they are people who have agreed to help them by mailing or by meeting up with them. For meet ups, they would need to give their consent to continue with the meet up. They can choose to accept any of the 3 meet-up details provided by the person who wants to help or they can choose to suggest another. However, i have not continued to build this part of the website.</p>
